He started by explaining that the Phantom Zone was inhabited by some sort of ghostly life. These beings were angry about being removed from their home by the projector and took out their anger by possessing various people who lived on Krypton. Zor-El then discovered that the only way to destroy the phantoms was with Kryptonian Sunstone. He implanted sunstones into her to make her immune to possession by the Phantoms. Shortly afterward, the students at the school Kara went to on Krypton were possessed by these Phantoms and they were forced to kill them all with sunstone. For this, the Kryptonian Science Council had decided that Zor-El, Kara, and Alura should be sentenced to exile in the Phantom Zone. However the final quakes before Krypton''s destruction interrupted this before the sentence could be carried out.

Desiring the Skull''s Cosmic Cube for himself, former Soviet general Aleksander Lukin hired Rogers'' former WWII sidekick, Bucky (now known as the Winter Soldier) to assassinate the Skull. When the Skull was shot, he attempted to use the Cube to switch bodies with Lukin to survive, but the cube was weak. The transfer was only partially successful as the Skull only managed to transfer his mind into Lukin''s body; now the minds of the two enemies were trapped together in the same body. The Skull/Lukin formed numerous alliances with other villains, including Doctor Faustus, Doctor Doom, Arnim Zola and the Serpent Squad. The Skull used hypnotist Dr. Faustus to help arrange Captain America''s assassination. Under Faustus'' influence, former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent and Cap''s occasional girlfriend Sharon Carter was brainwashed into killing Captain America herself. Freed from his ever-present nemesis, the Red Skull/Lukin raised a private army while attempting to arrange for Senator Gordon Wright to become president of the USA. The Winter Soldier became the new Captain America and overcame their plans. Arnim Zola transferred the Red Skull''s mind out of Lukin''s body and into one of his own spare android forms as a temporary measure.

He attended Pennsylvania State University on a football scholarship, where he met Robert Bruce Banner and became interested in gamma ray research. After graduating, Walter pursued his research independently while accepting a position with a professional football team, the Green Bay Packers, and married Veronica, an actress who bore him a son. After earning over a million dollars, Walter retired and returned to school, soon earning his Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Walter began teaching at McGill University in Montreal and furthered his gamma ray research, including studying BannerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s famous transformation into the Hulk, and Veronica soon divorced him, taking their son. At a new position with the Canadian governmentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Department H, Walter worked with James Hudson, whose plans for a new super-hero team would eventually lead to Alpha Flight. Langkowski acted as technical and scientific support for AlphaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s precursor, the Flight, which included Smart Alec, a brilliant man with access to vast amounts of information, Snowbird, a goddess with the power to change to any Arctic animal, and Wolverine, a vicious mutant with a mysterious past. Eventually, Langkowski exposed himself to gamma rays, hoping to gain powers like BannerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s. Instead he opened a mystic barrier that allowed the Great Beast Tanaraq to pass through, and Walter assumed its form, wrongly believing his powers came from the gamma radiation. At first, LangkowskiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s brain and personality remained in control of his monstrous Sasquatch form, and he joined Alpha Flight himself. \n\nAlpha FlightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s roster would change frequently over the years as they went through phases of government contracts and independent action. Walter studied many incoming operatives, who were generally assigned to training teams Beta and Gamma Flight, for Department H. One operative, later known as Wild Child, had a very unstable genotype and psychosis, but the government shoe-horned him into the program anyway. Langkowski buried Wild ChildÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s unstable results, figuring he would handle them at another time, though he never put much thought into it. In Alpha FlightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s earliest missions, Sasquatch battled the X-Men, the Hulk, Sunset Bain, Machine Man, Tundra of the Great Beasts, Ranark the Ravager and Wendigo. Sasquatch also participated in the \"Contest of Champions\" organized by the Grandmaster and Death, and, as one of the GrandmasterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s operatives, battled the Chinese Collective Man to a stalemate. Langkowski was consulted by the Fantastic Four for his radiation expertise, and battled the Dire Wraiths, Omega Flight (in a battle where Hudson was believed killed) and the Collector. \n\nBecoming fast friends with the diminutive Puck, Walter started a romantic relationship with the light-powered Aurora, a fact her twin Northstar resented immensely. Walter and AuroraÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s relationship became complicated when Aurora began struggling with split personalities, one that liked Walter and one that didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t. In the process of trying to help Aurora retain her more outgoing personality, Walter altered her mutant powers. Sasquatch discovered his ability to quickly heal from injuries after he broke his arm in a battle with the Super-Skrull.Langkowski eventually began struggling with a more bestial side of his nature during various battles, and feared he was becoming more like the Hulk. When his aunt, Lillian Von Loont, left Walter a mansion on Tamarind Island, Walter and Aurora investigated only to battle Loont, who had become the cyborg madwoman Gilded Lily. This mansion would later serve as Alpha FlightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s headquarters for a time. Sasquatch, alongside Alpha Flight and the X-Men, was temporarily cured of his rages by a Loki-possessed Madelyne Pryor. \n\nSnowbird, whose mission it was to slay the ancient Great Beasts who had roamed the Earth before mankind, discovered that WalterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Sasquatch form was actually Tanaraq, and Walter was now losing control. Left with no choice, Snowbird followed Alpha FlightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s battle with Caliber and slew Sasquatch by ripping out TanaraqÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s heart. Alpha Flight pursued WalterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s soul into the realm of the Great Beasts and battled their leader, Somon who killed Aurora, Northstar and Talisman before Langkowski used his life-force to resurrect them. Shaman helped preserve WalterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s soul as they transported back to Earth, only to discover that WalterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s body had been destroyed completely. WalterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s soul took over the Roger Bochs created Box armor as a temporary home and continued aiding Alpha Flight. Seeking a physical body, Walter entered the interdimensional Crossroads and briefly possessed the Hulk, but his soul was left adrift when he refused to displace his old friend Bruce BannerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s spirit. Months later, Walter found Omega FlightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s now-mindless Smart Alec in the Crossroads, possessed him, and returned to Earth. \n\nDuring his absence, Snowbird had been killed, and the evil Pestilence had reanimated her albino Sasquatch form and attacked Alpha. Walter inhabited the Box armor again and aided his team, who were shocked to find him alive. At the battleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s end, Smart AlecÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s form had been crushed and the Sasquatch form left empty, so Walter transferred his soul to the Sasquatch form; however, when he returned the Sasquatch body to human state, he found himself in a womanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s form. Deciding to call himself Wanda, Langkowski rejoined the team, possessing none of SnowbirdÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s powers except the ability to transform into the Sasquatch. Aurora was distressed at LangkowskiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s return as a woman and attempted to get the flesh-altering Lionel Jeffries to alter WandaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s form to a man again, but this failed due to WandaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s body having SnowbirdÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s godly attributes. Wanda struggled to adjust to her new form, and, after batting Bedlam, was overcome by a mysterious force and helped resurrect four of the Great Beasts. Overcoming the temptation to join them, Sasquatch helped Alpha Flight banish the Beasts back to their realm. After brief jaunts through space and Dream QueenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dimension, Wanda sought to reclaim LangkowskiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fortune to help fund Alpha Flight, but the fortune had been willed to Veronica; unable to prove she was Walter, Wanda left the fortune in VeronicaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hands. In final battle with the Dream Queen, Sasquatch was bewitched to be loyal to the villain until SnowbirdÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s spirit freed Sasquatch from the spell and changed WandaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s form back into WalterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s; this also changed the albino Sasquatch form back into the orange one, and enabled Walter to reclaim his fortune. \n\nThe team battled Llan the Sorcerer, a villain who briefly broke both of SasquatchÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s arms (though the injury soon healed). When Alpha Flight restructured itself, Sasquatch was assigned to both Alpha Flight and Gamma Flight, in the latter as Biotech research and development. When Wild Child joined the team as Weapon Omega, Walter struggled with guilt over his part in Wild ChildÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s origins and the truth soon came out, causing several team members to distrust Sasquatch. Alpha Flight continued to act as super-heroes despite breaking ties with the Canadian government over the newly instituted Super Powers Act. Struggling with all he had lost over the years by devoting all his time to Alpha Flight, Sasquatch was easily drawn into following the mystical Goddess, the \"good\" side of Adam WarlockÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s soul, who controlled Sasquatch and others into battling fellow heroes for her cause. Remembering his doubts regarding religion, Sasquatch shook off the GoddessÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s influence with ShamanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s help, and the Goddess was soon defeated. \n\nThough Alpha Flight soon disbanded, Walter continued his gamma ray research at Project Michelangelo in Antarctica. Months later, the mercenary Deadpool attacked the base and caused the core to overload, endangering the entire world, so Sasquatch and Deadpool teamed up to shut it down. The Canadian government, in forming a new Alpha Flight, discovered a true bestial Sasquatch in the woods and assumed it was Walter. Finding ways to subdue the beast, they had this Sasquatch participate in team missions until it was killed while battling EclipticÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Zodiac, and the team held a funeral for Walter. Still in Antarctica and unaware of the new team, Walter discovered corruption in the Canadian government. Sasquatch helped gather some of the original team and the group exposed the corrupt government program, then stayed on to rejoin Alpha Flight. While aiding Wolverine (actually a Skrull imposter)in a battle against A.I.M. (Advanced Idea Mechanics), Alpha Flight was shocked to find Snowbird alive again. Walter and Aurora became romantically involved once more, but Aurora was soon terrorized by Mauvais and kidnapped by the corrupt Weapon X program, leaving no trace of her whereabouts. When Alpha Flight went up against the X-Men again, Sasquatch briefly donned battle armor that allowed him to defeat a weakened Juggernaut. \n\nWhen all of his teammates were captured by the alien Plodex, Sasquatch recruited new heroes, formed a new Alpha Flight and rescued his former teammates. The former Alpha Flight members left for space, leaving SasquatchÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s team to take their place, move into the Plodex base, and sever ties with the Canadian government once again. Alpha Flight embarked on a complicated time travel adventure before the original Alpha Flight members returned and rejoined the team. After speaking at NorthstarÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s funeral and battling Sabretooth and Wendigo, Sasquatch briefly participated in S.H.I.E.L.D.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Howling Commandos team. He later accompanied Alpha Flight in investigating the powerful mutant Collective, but they swiftly fell before his assault. His teammates Guardian, Major Mapleleaf, both Pucks, Vindicator, and Shaman, were all apparently killed and Alpha Flight was disbanded in the wake of the tragedy. However, a new team was quickly assembled by CSIS to replace them, this time called Omega Flight. Sasquatch was selected to serve','','',''),(514,'1516609385-6979','Blob',10,85,25,95,30,75,'Frederick J.

Later, the X-Men were captured by the assassin Arcade, who brainwashed Colossus into believing he was the Proletarian, workers'' hero of communist Russia, and turned him against his teammates.

Soon after, the X-Men recruited young mutant Kitty Pryde. Despite their initial shyness, a romance blossomed between her and Colossus.

He met Mystique in Germany, when she was married to a rich castle lord named Baron Christian Wagner. With Christian unable to give her children, Mystique was introduced to Azazel, whom Christian knew as a business partner. Mystique had secretly been taking lovers to produce an heir to Count Wagner. Mystique fell in love with him, and although she was hesitant to betray Christian as she still loved him, she gave in to Azazel and they made love. Not much later, Mystique was pregnant with Nightcrawler. Soon afterward, she killed Christian because he suspected her betrayal. She had gone looking for him but he was nowhere to be found. It is later known that Azazel was taking care of business involving the Cheyarafim, and had to leave knowing that Mystique would find some way to live. However, she didn''t have much time to formulate a plan, as the angry villagers soon found out about Christian''s murder and came after her and the demonic looking baby. In order to save her own life, she shape-shifted into one of the villagers and dropped Nightcrawler over the cliff, saying she pushed the woman off too. With her own life saved, she ran away.

During his first appearance his strength overwhelmed that of Goku during several moments in their battle and nearly killed him however as time passed Goku surpassed his strength however Vegeta has equaled and passed Goku''s strength several times. Without using his chi-boosting ability, Vegeta''s strength baseline is very close to Goku''s allowing him to lift/press 100 to 150 tons with minimal effort. In his SuperSayin 1 form, Vegeta is at least capable of lifting/pressing at least 7500 tons. At the end of Dragon Ball GT, Vegeta like Goku achieves the final Super Saiyan form the Super Saiyan 4 and is well matched to Goku in terms of power. Vegeta can lift over 145,000 tons ,and the upper limits of his strength capacity are unknown.\"},{\"powers\":\"Superhuman Speed\"},{\"powers\":\"Vegeta''s Saiyan body grants him superhuman speed greater than that of any human in the universe. He moves and reacts at superhuman speed and as has been shown to move excessively faster than cars and is capable of moving well over many times the speed of sound, and arguably surpassing light speed as he is shown to routinely dodge ki beams which have previously been clocked at or beyond the speed of light.\"},{\"powers\":\"Superhuman Durability\"},{\"powers\":\"Like all Saiyans, Vegeta''s body is superhumanly durable however has been shown to not be as durable as Goku from time to time however at the end of Dragon Ball GT it is highly likely that he had become physically as durable as Goku. Vegeta can withstand high caliber bullets, powerful explosions and destructive energy blasts without sustaining damage and has several feats of durability such as withstanding energy blasts capable of destroying entire cities, and easily surpassing the durability of Frieza, who survived the planet Namek''s explosion while already half dead. In the anime and manga, Vegeta is shown to be capable of taking quite a beating; referencing his fights with Frieza and Kid Buu. In the anime Vegeta is seen withstanding the destruction of several planets at once by his father, when he was still a small child. Vegeta is also capable of withstanding heavy blows from very powerful enemies such as Super Buu, Omega Shenron, Super 17 and more. Vegeta was also shown as the most durable of the posse that was present with him when facing Super 17 and the most difficult to deal with with the exception of Goku.\"},{\"powers\":\"Energy Manipulation\"},{\"powers\":\"Vegeta has complete mastery over his energy manipulation and can use it for things such as energy blasts, energy waves, energy balls, energy spheres, energy shields and more. Vegeta is able to create colossal energy blasts powerful enough to easily destroy entire planets without using his full power, his favorite blasts throughout the series and his most powerful ones are Galick Gun, Final Flash and Final Shine Attack. It is noted during his battle with Android 18 that he has the ability to destroy the planet if serious, and is again noted that during Vegeta''s battle with Perfect Cell when he launched a very powerful Final Flash that the Earth would have been destroyed on impact if he had not condensed the beam at the final second. Even during his first encounter with Goku he attempted to destroy the Earth with his Galick Gun attack but his attack was countered with Goku''s Kamehameha blast and that could hint that Vegeta has destroyed planets before with single energy blasts. In the anime Vegeta easily destroys the planet Arlia with a casual blast from his fingertips. Aside from energy blasts Vegeta can create large energy balls his most powerful being The Big Bang Attack which he used to destroy Android 19 during his battle with him when he was a Super Saiyan. Vegeta can manipulate different types of energy the most common being ki for it is highly likely that before Vegeta arrived on Earth he did not how to sense and change ki at will. Vegeta can use the energy around him to enhance or and increase his power(including physical attributes) he does this by gathering the energy in his environment and a sign that the energy is being gathered is when a flame-like aura is formed around his body and when he increases his energy by gathering more energy when the aura is around him it begins to flicker as the energy begins to shift further increasing his power. He can also channel the energy through his body to increase his physical strength and can concentrate ki or any energy into single areas of his body such as fists to use energy enhanced strikes as spheres of dense energy form around his fists. Vegeta can also sense the energy of other beings and can use this ability to follow their energy signatures and locate the beings.\"},{\"powers\":\"Telepathy\"},{\"powers\":\"Naturally like all Saiyans, Vegeta has the natural mental ability of telepathy. Vegeta can use his telepathy to communicate with other beings however he is unable to launch mental attacks or protect his mind using mental abilities.\"},{\"powers\":\"Teleportation\"},{\"powers\":\"Vegeta can seemingly teleport several distances as he is seen suddenly appearing behind enemies by reappearance however this is probably an after image technique coupled with extreme super speed rather than truly teleportation, as it is never hinted that Vegeta know the Instant Transmission (Shunkan Ido) Technique.\"},{\"powers\":\"Superhuman Stamina\"},{\"powers\":\"Vegeta''s Saiyan physiology produces less fatigue poisons than any human and he can engage in intense physical activity for weeks before the production of fatigue toxins begin to impale his blood and body. His stamina is further increased by his intense training.\"},{\"powers\":\"Superhuman Agility\"},{\"powers\":\"His body grants him superhuman agility, greater bodily coordination and balance than any human in the universe and he is able to engage in complicated and humanly impossible physical acrobatic movements and his agility allows him to dodge and evade light speed fast attacks.\"},{\"powers\":\"Flight\"},{\"powers\":\"Like all Saiyans, Vegeta is able to engage in flight and has complete mastery over it as he is able to perfectly levitate, hover, spin swiftly while maintaining the same altitude and balance and can easily dodge fast projectiles while airborne. Vegeta flies incredibly fast and can fly at high atmospheric pressures and intense and harsh temperatures and environments. In the anime only Garlic Junior Saga he is even seen flying between nearby planets.\"},{\"powers\":\"Super Eating\"},{\"powers\":\"Vegeta like all Saiyans has the natural ability of super eating. Vegeta consumes enormous amounts of food however this is rather out of sustenance and the need to replenish his energy rather than sheer lust for food however there has been on one occasion where he gets into a fight against Goku because each one claims the other stole the other''s food and this could be out of pure love of food.\"},{\"powers\":\"Unarmed Combat\"},{\"powers\":\"Vegeta is a master of hand to hand combat and is an extremely smart and intelligent fighter finding out his enemies weaknesses and using them to his advantage. Vegeta normally observes his opponent''s fighting style and rapidly creates counters for virtually every maneuver he witnesses, he is a master of many hand to hand fight styles as he was an elite Saiyan warrior and is a master martial artist on Earth and has even overwhelmed Goku in all of their battles with his skill and dexterity proving that his skills is more than enough for Goku to handle. He is arguably the smartest fighter in all of DBZ (Piccolo being the wisest and most careful) and he is functionally a better fighter than Goku in terms of pure skill.\"},{\"powers\":\"Ki Awareness\"},{\"powers\":\"Can sense others who have significant power and their locations.

However he has trained endlessly to enhance the power increase in this form. He is immensely strong and is shown to be STRONGER than Goku''s Super Saiyan 3 in this form after the Battle of the Gods movie. Bills was able to stop Super Saiyan 3 Goku with a finger, but when Bills slaps bulma, Vegeta is able to give Bills a good beating until he gets serious.\"},{\"powers\":\"Revenge Deathball\"},{\"powers\":\"A spirit bomb created of evil dark energy and is charged up much faster than Goku''s.

At the end of the First Age, Sauron took on a fair form to appeal to the Captain of the Hosts of the Valar and ask for pardon. In the Second Age, Sauron took up that fair form again and used it under the alias \"\"Annatar\"\" to deceive the Elves into creating the Rings of Power. The level of deception required to fool the Elves of Eregion must have gone beyond simply taking on a fair form. Sauron was literally instructing the Elves to make artifacts that while capable of great good, were ultimately purposed for his own domination and were imbued with power to arrest the natural order of the world. The Elves were unaware of who they were dealing with until the eleventh hour, and only narrowly escaped his trap. Centuries later, Sauron was able to deceive the NÃƒÆ’Ã‚ÂºmenÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³reans and steer them directly to their own destruction under promises of eternal life. Such destruction is a testament to Sauron''s manipulative nature and ability to twist the perceptions of his enemies.\"},{\"powers\":\"An interesting dichotomy is set up between his deceptive nature and his symbol. While rarely appearing personally and deceiving all but the most wary, he represented himself as an all seeing eye that could pierce all disguises. Consistent with Tolkien''s theme of evil being finite, wasteful, and self-destructive, Sauron''s powers gradually decreased as time went on. After the Fall of NÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âºmenor he was incapable of taking physical form for many years, and then later became a horrific Dark Lord. After losing the Ring it took even longer for him to regain physical form, although by the War of the Ring he had regained it.\"},{\"powers\":\"The extent, nature, and specifics of Sauron''s power are largely left to the imagination. Like his master Morgoth, he was capable of altering the physical substance of the world around him by mere effort of will.\"}]','',''),(2244,'1516608748-6411','Cy-Gor',0,0,0,0,0,0,'-','No alter egos found.','-','-','-','Image Comics','bad','Male','null','0 cm','0 kg','-','-','-','-','-','','','[]','[{\"weapons\":\"-\"}]'),(2251,'1516607468-4443','Indigo',75,65,50,50,100,50,'-','No alter egos found.','Indigo-1','-','Green Lantern Vol 4 #25 (January, 2008)','DC Comics','neutral','Female','Alien','0 cm','0 kg','-','Purple','Leader of the Indigo Tribe','-','-','','','[{\"equipments\":\"Indigo Power Ring\"},{\"equipments\":\"Indigo Tribe Staff\"}]','[{\"weapons\":\"-\"}]'),(2254,'1516607041-3860','King Shark',50,90,50,90,90,40,'-','No alter egos found.','-','-','Superboy Vol 4 #0','DC Comics','bad','Male','Animal','0 cm','0 kg','Black','No Hair','Professional Criminal','Honolulu, Hawaii','-','','','[]','[{\"weapons\":\"-\"}]'),(2255,'1516605262-1659','She-Thing',70,75,25,80,25,65,'Sharon Ventura','Ms Marvel II','Thing, Ms Marvel','-','Thing #27','Marvel Comics','good','Female','Human / Radiation','183 cm','153 kg','Blue','No Hair','Prisoner, former adventurer, wrestler, stuntwoman, scuba diver, motorcycle performer','-','Jack Ventura (father, deceased), Mrs. Ventura (mother, deceased)','','','[]','[{\"weapons\":\"-\"}]'),(2258,'1516608193-5580','Firelord',40,65,75,90,55,30,'Pyreus Kril','No alter egos found.','Nova Centurion','Xander, planet in Tranta System, Andromeda Galaxy','THOR Vol. 1 #225','Marvel Comics','good','-','null','193 cm','99 kg','White','Yellow','Former starship captain, former herald of Galactus','Mobile; usually in space','-','','','[]','[{\"weapons\":\"Firelord carries a near-indestructible staff five feet in length, the ends of which he keeps ablaze with his cosmic flame.

Even the handle of the gun was made from a portion of the True Cross. Hellboy called the gun The Good Samaritan because he would put monsters out of their misery.

When his uncle was besieged by attackers in the building, Phil hid and tried to find help. Stumbling upon an experimental new Green Goblin costume Phil also fell into a chamber of the Goblin Formula. \n\nQuickly dressing up in the suit, he scared off the hoods. Later on, he decided that the costume and equipment were worth using. \n\nAfter his discovery of the Goblin arsenal and equipment, Phil ran into the Scarlet Spider, Rhino, the Hobgoblin, Joystick and others. Many were unsure of his purpose and motives as they were also curious about this new Goblin on the scene. \n\nIt was not until a corrupt judge targeted Ben and sent the assassin Purge to kill him that Phil decided to take on his new persona with responsibility. Teaming up with Daredevil the pair were able to stop Purge. \n\nThis act gave the new hero a lot of attention and he developed a small but devoted following.

Depending on the combat situation they are being deployed into the equipment carried by a Spartan changes. However they have some all purpose weapons and euipment. \n\nEvery Spartan wears at least the MJOLNIR Mark V and several have the Mark VI model which have thermal optic and infrared vision modes. Cameras are also planted in the Spartan''s helmet as it is standard procedure to record all missions for future review. Weapons are carried through the use of magnetic adhesive strips in specific locations such as the back and thighs, allowing Spartans to carry both human and covenant technology or even tactical HAVOK nukes for demolition work. Their armour also has the capability to carry an AI construct, such as Cortana. They are used to provide tactical guidance, provide objectives, hack into enemy communications channels and devices, analyze data, weapons, machines and identify specific threats. A flash light in the side of the helmet that runs off a recharging fusion power pack in the back of the armor is also included. Also, the visor of a Spartan provides a real time HUD (heads up display) and can provide weapon info, ammunition used and remaining, health and pulse monitors, energy shield status, active motion tracker and way points laid down by an AI. The MJOLNIR Mark VI has its own supply of biofoam and when a Spartan is wounded it is automatically administered. This foam stops blood loss and can temporarily replace muscle tissue, allowing the Spartan to continue to function even when wounded.\n\nThe most important piece of equipment for a Spartan is his or her MJOLNIR armor, a full-body suit with a reflective visor. The armor consists of green ceramic outer plates with metallic inner plating. The suit augments neural ability, with slight commands becoming big motions with big results. It also allows for an AI to interface with the suit, acting as a layer between the suit and the brain. An AI interfacing with the suit provides improved response time, among other things. The first version of this armor put into use was the MJOLNIR Mark IV, which Dr. Halsey tasked John''s team to retrieve. This entry-level version was rather primitive compared to newer incarnations, and because of conditions on Reach, spare parts were not available. Just before the Master Chief was deployed to Halo Installation 04, all available Spartans on Reach upgraded to the Mark V, which added an automatically-recharging energy shield to protect the wearer from initial damage. On his return from the original Halo the Chief was equipped with a new permutation of the amour. This latest armor is even more powerful, with a slightly more resilient shield, off-hand coordination enhancements that allow the wearer to wield two small weapons accurately, ammunition and heat tracking for the second weapon, and enhanced zoom capabilities using the helmet''s visor. The suit was originally designed for use by unaugmented humans. Tests of this suit showed that the neural interface that allows the suit to move at a thought was too fast for an average human soldier, which proved fatal for the personnel inside. When given to the Spartans it proved to be manageable. The suit''s codename MJOLNIR attests to this fact; in Norse mythology, Thor''s hammer Mjolnir was too heavy to be carried by any but the strongest of body and mind. The Spartans quickly adapted to the suit and it is now an important addition to their arsenal.\"}]','[{\"weapons\":\"The origional Spartans mainly used the MA5B, MA2B (a shortened version of the MA5B with an attachable silencer), M6D magnum and fiber optic cables.\n\nThe Master Chief also has another weapon that only he has, Cortana, the A.I.

Since XiÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½an had come back from Saigon with visions of peace between human and mutantkind, Junkpile felt that he had strayed from his destiny. Junkpile believed that mutants were born with the power to do what they wanted, and to try to work for peace with weaker humans would degrade them. So that when the Synge Corporation thought XiÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½an had murdered their founder, Noah Synge, Junkpile gave them enough information to raid XiÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½anÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s gathering and kill him. But the assassination failed, and Junkpile was forced to fight his ex-teammates and kidnap an injured XiÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½an. As Junkpile had installed a psionic jammer that kept Cerebra out of his head, Serpentina wasnÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½t strong enough to hurt him, and Timothy Fitzgerald couldnÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½t use his powers properly, taking XiÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½anÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s body was easy. After returning to the Synge Corporations headquarters with XiÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½an, Junkpile later stopped Krystalin from killing the corporationÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s new head, Lytton Synge, and then fought the X-Men that had come to save XiÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½an and clear his name. Serpentina attacked him impulsively, and he killed her by shoving her face against the wall, which galvanized the rest of the X-Men to attack him. But none of them were strong enough to hurt him until XiÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½an appeared revived and used the disintegrating power of his left hand to disable Junkpile. And though Junkpile threatened that if XiÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½an didnÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½t kill him, he would come after him, XiÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½an believed he would eventually see his mistake and return as a friend, and so let him live.','','',''),(3238,'1516608278-5644','Evilhawk',50,35,35,70,85,65,'Dargin Bokk','No alter egos found.','-','-','Darkhawk #20 (October, 1992)','Marvel Comics','bad','Male','Alien','191 cm','106 kg','Red','Black','Crimelord','(Formerly) planet Luq','-','','','[]','[{\"weapons\":\"He utilized a clawed-cable on his right hand, it was generally used as a grappling hook.\"}]'),(3280,'1516606326-3146','Moses Magnum',75,30,15,45,55,60,'Moses Magnum','No alter egos found.','Magnum Force,','-','Giant-Size Spider-Man #4 (1975)','Marvel Comics','bad','Male','null','175 cm','72 kg','Brown','Black','Terrorist, president of Magnum Munitions; former ruler of Canaan','-','-','','','[]','[{\"weapons\":\"Prior to his empowerment, MagnumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s weapons included finger-mounted force blasters and knockout gas.\"}]'),(3306,'1516607683-4740','Hawkwoman II',0,0,0,0,0,0,'Sharon Parker','No alter egos found.','-','-','-','DC Comics','good','Female','null','0 cm','0 kg','-','-','-','-','-','','','[]','[{\"weapons\":\"-\"}]'),(3328,'1516607950-5076','Godzilla',45,100,55,100,100,20,'-','No alter egos found.','Legendary Godzilla, King of the Monsters, Gigantis, Monster Zero-One, God of Destruction, Alpha Predator','-','Godzilla (1954)','','bad','-','Kaiju','108.0 meters','90,000 tons','-','-','-','-','-','','[{\"powers\":\"Over the years Godzilla has possessed many powers and abilities to use against his foes.

Ice cold calculation wrapped with a passion for violence. All driven by the organic heart of a murderer. This is OvertKill. Literally a ''Mafia-made man''. Nicholas Rocca. Born and raised in Palermo, Sicily. At the age of thirteen, he was extorting protection money from village store owners and selling his already powerful talents as a leg breaker to other youths. At the age of fifteen, he caught the notice of Sicily''s top boss of organized crime, Luciano Bartino, by killing two of Bartino''s best thugs with his bare hands. Instead of having young Rocca killed for his crime, Bartino took Rocca under his wing and began training him to channel his strength and violence for his own use. Nicholas Rocca became known as The Palermo Pit Bull. His body continued to grow as large as his thirst to punish. Bartino took great pleasure in knowing that all of organized crime both envied and feared his hulking hit man. In one of his murderous rampages across the Strait of Messina into Calabria, Rocca killed the son of Vito Calogero. Calogero, a long time rival of Bartino, was enraged. He quickly made plans to kill Rocca. Calling in favors from the oil-rich Arabs that he had helped out on occasion, Calogero had the out-of-town Arabs ambush Rocca. Using over 50 gunmen, the Arabs nearly shred Rocca into hundreds of pieces. He was left for dead. Rocca was found by Bartino''s men and brought home. Through a miracle or the fact that a heart so evil refused to die, Rocca still had a flicker of life left in him. While in Sicily on business with Bartino, Tony Twist, the crime boss of New York, used this moment to seal himself to the debt of Bartino. Twist suggests that Bartino try once more to make a Mafia super hit man like they did once before with the failed Tremor attempt. This time they would have a willing patient in Rocca. They would also use more bionics. Rocca begged Bartino to do it. Revenge now fueled the flames to keep Nicholas Rocca alive. The experiment in the paramesh system went far beyond their expectations. Rocca''s body and mind embraced the operation fully. That night Nicholas Rocca became the name whispered in fear by the Mafia''s enemies - OvertKill! The first order on OvertKill''s menu of manslaughter was the death of Vito Calogero and his crime family. It was done in a flashburn of mayhem. OvertKill''s name became a legend in the circles of organized crime throughout the world. Bartino began using OvertKill as a way of having other members of the organization become indebted to him. He would loan OvertKill''s services out for favors to be named later. One such loan was made to Tony Twist. Twist brought OvertKill to New York to crush Spawn. It was by far the most physical battle that Spawn had ever dealt with in his short time back from the dead. If not for a mechanical oversight with Overt-Kill''s circuits, he would have caused Al Simmons to be the only person to die,twice.','','',''),(3971,'1516604619-606','Thundra',40,85,35,65,30,55,'Thundra','No alter egos found.','-','-','Fantastic Four #129 (December, 1972)','Marvel Comics','good','Female','null','218 cm','158 kg','Green','Red','Ruler, warrior','Mobile; United Sisterhood Republic of North America','Superia (alleged ancestor), Arkon (consort) Lyra (alternate reality daughter)','','','[]','[{\"weapons\":\"Thundra commonly uses a chain as a weapon.\"}]'),(4045,'1516606379-3195','Monarch',0,0,0,0,0,0,'Nathaniel Christopher Adam','No alter egos found.','Monarch, Allen Adam, Cameron Scott, Captain Atom','-','Captain Atom #1 (D.C., March, 1987)','DC Comics','good','Male','null','193 cm','90 kg','Blue','White','Adventurer, former U.S. Special Agent, former U.S. Air Force Captain','-','Angela Adams (wife, deceased), Margaret Eiling (daughter), Randall Eiling (son)','','[{\"powers\":\"Dilustel Armor\nCaptain Atom''s metallic shell, or \"\"skin\"',' Project Major Force and similar projects thereafter.
